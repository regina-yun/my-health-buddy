        body: "On Odd Days\n\n Do 200 push-ups in as few sets as possible in addition to your regularly scheduled workout of cardio exercises. You still can do upper-body workouts on these days if you are already on a program. This is a supplemental 200 push-ups using maximum repetition sets (4 x 50, 8 x 25 ... it's your choice how you get to 200). \n\nOn Even Days\n\nDo 200 push-ups throughout the day. This can be little sets of 10 done every half-hour or 50 push-ups done four times throughout the day.\n\nRule\n\nIf your maximum is under 50 push-ups, do 200 a day. If your maximum is above 75, do 300 a day.\nRepeat the odd/even routine for 10 days. Then take three days off and do no upper-body pushing exercises that work the chest, triceps and shoulders. Then on day 14, give yourself the push-up test (one or two minutes, depending on your physical fitness test). I would not recommend this workout more than once every six months, since it rather challenges on the same muscle groups repeatedly.\n\nThere are three main types of push-ups you can do to break up the monotony: \"regular,\" \"wide\" and triceps pushups.",

And the folks who inhabit these locales, including places as diverse as Loma Linda, California, and Okinawa, Japan, don't just live longer on average. \n\nThey often avoid the health problems we might consider inevitable as we age./n/nDiabetes. Heart disease. Obesity. Of course, many factors contribute to making a zone blue. But regional cuisine almost certainly plays a role.",
